        Discuss the Scope of var,let and Const
      </h1> <br/>
      <p>
        Variables declared with var are function-scoped. This means they are
        only accessible within the function in which they are defined.
        If a var variable is declared outside of any function, it becomes a global variable,
        accessible throughout the entire script.
      </p> <br />
      <p>
        Variables declared with let are block-scoped, which means they are only accessible
        within the nearest enclosing curly braces ({}), whether that's a function, loop, or
        conditional block. They are not accessible outside of the block in which they are defined.
      </p> <br />
      <p>
        Variables declared with const are also block-scoped, just like let. They are only
        accessible within the nearest enclosing block.

        Tell us the use cases of null and undefined
      </h1> <br/>
      <p>
        It's important to use null when you want to indicate the explicit
        absence of a value or to reset a variable or property to a non-value
        state. On the other hand, undefined typically represents the
        unintentional absence of a value, such as when a variable hasn't been
        initialized or a property doesn't exist. In general, it's a good
        practice to use null when you want to assign a specific value to
        indicate absence or reset, and let JavaScript assign undefined when it
        represents the natural state of something not having a value yet.

      <h1 class="text-3xl font-bold">What do you mean by REST <br/>API</h1> <br/> 
      <p>
        REST APIs are used to allow different software systems to communicate
        with each other over the internet using HTTP (Hypertext Transfer
        Protocol) methods. <br />
        RESTful APIs use standard HTTP methods to perform actions on
        resources. The most commonly used HTTP methods are: <br />
        GET: Retrieve data from the server. POST: Create a new resource on the
        server. <br />
        PUT: Update an existing resource on the server (or create it if it
        doesn't exist). <br />
        PATCH: Partially update a resource. <br />
        DELETE: Remove a resource from the server.
